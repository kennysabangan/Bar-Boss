# Bar Boss
Inventory control system intended for bar owners / managers to easily store and calculate product inventory and costs.

## Setup ##
* Make sure MongoDB is installed in your computer: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
* Request the ".env" file required for this application from me at: ksabangan121@gmail.com

## Installation ##
* Clone the Repo
* Open new terminal windows for the "client" and the "server" directories
* Run: <code>npm install</code> in each terminal window
* In the "client" terminal run: <code>npm run start</code> to start up the client
* Check if the client is working by visiting: http://localhost:3000
* In the "server" terminal run: <code>nodemon server.js</code> to start up the MongoDB database
* The server is working if it says: "Listening on port: 8000. Established a connection to the database"

<i>Note: If you do not request the .env file from me, a majority of the application will not work.</i>
